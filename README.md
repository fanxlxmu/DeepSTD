This is the implementation of DeepSTD in the following paper: \
Chuanpan Zheng, Xiaoliang Fan, Chengwu Wen, Longbiao Chen, Cheng Wang, and Jonathan Li. "[DeepSTD: Mining Spatio-temporal Disturbances of Multiple Context Factors for Citywide Traffic Flow Prediction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8793226)", published in *IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems* *(T-ITS)*, Vol. 21, Issue 9, pp. 3744-3755, 2019.

## Data

The Chengdu dataset with 500m*500m grid size and 15-minute time interval is provided in the './data' folder.

## Requirements

Python 3.7.10, tensorflow 1.14.0, numpy 1.16.4, pandas 0.24.2

## Results

We provide a pre-trained model, which achieve the following performance:

|    Chengdu     |  Workday   |   Weekend    |  All days  | 
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------ | --------   | 
| DeepSTD        | 10.36      | 10.78        | 10.48      |
